        <h2>What are Pocket Monsters?</h2>
            <p class="poke">Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The
                Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from
                Ken Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of
                role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred as the "core series" by their developers

                    <p>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the
                        three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new
                        players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety
                        of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

                        players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire
                        variation starter is often a plus.

                        players.Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types
                        that are resistant to Grass moves.

                    out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of
                    themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July
                    and December.</p>

        <h2>Q and A</h2>
        <h4>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?
                <ul>
                    <li> We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of
                        Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's
                        evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of
                        generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild.
                        Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>
                    <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?
                <ul>
                    <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with,
                        but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild
                        Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've
                        reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is
                        a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.
                    </li>
                    <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon games, but the effect of those
                type matchups is slightly different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have
                slightly different multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought
                them slightly closer in line.</p>

                  The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were
                  created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red and
                  Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime
                  after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original
                  Green version was not released outside Japan
